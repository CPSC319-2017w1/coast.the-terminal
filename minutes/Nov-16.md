### Notes
* For next week lecture and meeting times are switched (meeting is on Tuesday and lecture is on Thursday)
* Collisions: if we end up implementing it, it will be added into the document as a stretch goal
* For the final demo: we need to have the documentation (15% of the final grade), system (code) (70% of the final grade), warranty period (15% of the final grade)
* For the warranty period: they will try to deploy the code by themselves and we need to be responsive for problems or questions
