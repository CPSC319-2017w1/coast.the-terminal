### The new features
* Bugs
  * We are aware of the bug, don’t know what is causing it, but will be working on it
* It is not intuitive to use
  * We will be having a tutorial for them
* Filtering vs. Reports
  * Generating the report is not intuitive so we will be having a tutorial for it
---
### Admin panel
* Error message doesn’t look like an actual error. It would be good to make it look like an actual error. E.g. Red text, etc.
---
### Add contractor
* Adding hourly rate throws an error
  * Bug preventing change to the hourly pay (it’s always set to 0)
---
### Questions
* The deployment document is pretty much the same as the AWS documents. 
  * If it’s the same then it’s safe to just reference the AWS document
* How long is the demo?
  * 15 minutes
  * Not part of the grade
* Why give the code on the stick?
  * A team before wiped their repo after their demo so this is a safe-keep
  * We need to make sure things that are not needed are not on there and things that are needed like documents are on there
---
### Stretch goals
* We should aim to fix the bugs and deliver the main features first, then we can focus on other things
* We have the two weeks after the final deadline on Thursday to add extra features
---
