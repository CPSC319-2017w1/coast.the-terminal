### Test Plan Feedback
* Risk analysis was too high level
* Didn’t include cases like empty/duplicate data
* Didn’t include number of scripts for test cases
* (Most importantly) For the manual testing scripts they were also pretty high level, it would have been better to have more detail
---
### Feedback on the link
* Not much functionality for now
* Since there isn’t much they can’t test it out
---
### Config help on the release notes
* PDF document explaining how to setup, configure, and deploy
---
### Questions for CC
* Send them questions about testing if there are any
---
### Asking for updates from CC
* Jerry said we didn’t ask for updates, but we did ask for feedback on the midterm and whenever needed
* Jerry said we were kind of expected to ask for help from CC. His worry is that since our product so far doesn’t look close to working we should ask for help sooner rather than later.

### Updates from the team
* Back-end is 90% done, there are only edit tables left to implement
* Front-end is left, and same with connecting the backend to the frontend
* Admin panel and dashboard and add contractors should be getting close to being done in the next three or four days
* Deploy new updates to show we’re actually making progress
---
### Updates from Jerry
* Instead of the lecture we will have another team meeting at the usual team meeting time.
