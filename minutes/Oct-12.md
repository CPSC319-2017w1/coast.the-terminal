### Design Doc Feedback
* Tools that we’re using should have included version number of each tool
* Should have more detail on how APIs work
  * RESTful
    * URLs
    * Return values
* Which class is connecting to the database?
* Notes on the front-end architecture
  * How do we plan to implement it?
  * Classes and/or objects (components?)
* Administrator specific tasks could have been included in the diagrams

### Presentation
* Presenting the live documents
  * Should send the slides to Anna (by Tuesday)
  * Should have intractable demo
* Can we have a video instead of interacting demo?
  * We need to show them the progress that we have made in the actual project
  * The video is good to show them what it will look like in the future and give them the actual project to interact with
* Project status
  * Are we expected to show them the “red, green, yellow” demo thing?
    * Not necessarily, the RTM should be enough
* Risks: Mention the ones in the previous documents
* What are actionable items?
  * If we notice that they want something that we should add them to our todo list
  * What is for us to do after the presentation
* It’s ok for use cases to be in appendices
* We can assume they have read the documents we’ve sent them beforehand
* When presenting keep in mind that they don’t have a strong technical background so don’t show any code or anything but do tell them what technology we’re using
* Once we send the presentation to Anna it should be the final version so don’t expect any feedback on that
---
* Expectations:
  * Make the presentation and give it to Anna beforehand
  * Be mindful on the timing
  * Take notes during the meeting
  * Be honest with them
