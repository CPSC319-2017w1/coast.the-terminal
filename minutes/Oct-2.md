# Agenda

* What all do we need for the DESIGN doc? (this is 10% of our grade - level of detail: If your project teams wins the Lotto 649 jackpot and decides to leave UBC, can a new competent technical team be able to decipher how to build the solution from your design document?)
    * Technical Requirements (some examples in slides)
    * Database Design
    * UI Design aka Screen Mockups
    * UML diagrams
        * Activity Flow
        * Class Diagram
    * Anything else I am missing? (just from the slides)
      * Introduction – Overview, goals and assumption of your system
      * Programming environment - Detail the programming tools and languages. Specify IDE, programming language(s) versions, databases, source control system, UML tool, etc.
      * Production and Test environments
      * Software architecture - Your program hierarchy (basically UML) 
      * Data design
         * Specify the format of the data including normalize specification and **ER diagrams** as necessary.
      * API design - Show clear specification of the API as needed (assuming you are providing or given APIs).
      * Algorithms - Specify any complex algorithms used in your system. **
      * **Notable tradeoffs – Identify design tradeoff (ie: need to make certain design decisions based on time, quality, performance, security or scope considerations).**
      * **Notable risks – Highlight the potentially risk of not meeting the system requirements.**

* Lets start working on login and Adding/Viewing contractor data.
    * Our aim should be to complete it by next Wednesday.
    * Stephen and I will start implementing the database design this week.
    * Anushka and Shrey can figure out the UI implementation.
    * Maia and Shrey can figure out the API calls that would need to be made.
