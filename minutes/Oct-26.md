### Feedback on the midterm
* Meeting notes were missing title, attendee names, and date
* Presentation had full sentences with “I think…”
---
### Plans for next week
* Frontend: Add contractor records
* Backend: Add/edit contractor, admin APIs
---
### What to expect for Test Plan
* Test plan includes summary, and the previous texts can be used as that
* Write things like individual test cases for major components
* Functional testing: Version of the test software, important unit tests, integration tests
* Non-functional testing (less important): How are you approaching it?
* Example input -> Expected output
* How are you testing the security?
* How are you testing the database?
* What are you using for test data?
* Order it by most important to least important
---
### Notes
* The higher grade between the midterm vs the test plan will - have a higher weight.
* Public link is due next week
  * If we update it regularly the TAs and Prof will look at it and give feedback occasionally
  * We should give them a heads up on what is expected to happen in the most recent deployment on Piazza
