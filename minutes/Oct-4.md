# Agenda

* How exactly are we planning to filter
    * lodash (?). Maia to discuss more with us.
* Visualization tools
    * Lets make a decision on which tool we want to visualize.
    * Tableau vs D3 vs Chart.js- Pros and Cons
        * Tableau we would be sending data to external server. What is their API limit and Security policy?
        * Should we really be dependent on an external server for doing filtering if we can just do filtering in the client side?
        * Which one has better integration with IE11?
* Algorithms we will be using
    * We should include everything as an algorithm that we are doing that is not normal or usual.
    * I asked the prof and he mentioned we do not need to focus and worry about this as our thing is pretty straightforward.
* Database Design
    * We should have it in 3rd Normal Form.
    * Our Database Instance is deployed on AWS via RDS.
* App Deployment
    * Stephen suggests AWS. We can easily integrate our deployed database it.
    * Seems fairly straightforward.
* API deisgn
    * We should talk about all the external libraries that we are using.
    * And a description of our own REST API.
    * Coast Capital DO NOT WANT dynamic-created queries.
* Security
    * Slides say that Coast Capital want everything encrypted. So, we would have to set it up over HTTPS instead of HTTP.
    * Dont think it will be too hard.
* Potential tradeoffs:
    * Tradeoffs between fast vs good vs cheap. And how they impact stuff like quality, security, peroformance, etc
