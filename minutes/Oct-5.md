# Agenda

* Preliminary feedback on Requirements doc - what it missed, what it did well, what we need to update on it 
* Feedback on Design doc
    * this is what we're currently writing about
    * is there anything we're missing; anything in particular you're looking for
* The introduction for the design doc is repetitive of the previous documents (i.e. with goals, assumptions and overview)
    * is it okay to just copy paste from a previous doc so we don't have to re-write it?
* Midterm questions
    * what will the structure look like
    * what is expected to be shown
    * i.e. what should we focus on because this is **2 weeks** from now 
* how important are updates to the previous documents? Or is it just for good practice?
