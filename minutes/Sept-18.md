1. Finalize the project plan
	* Figure out what all information needs to go in this document
		* Start with who will be the one reading it
	* I thought of having an Overview, Estimated Schedule, Design Plan, Development Plan, Testing Plan
		* Figure out how we want to fill this information
2. Finalize the requirements
	* Prepare for the meeting with Coast Capital on Thursday
		* Collect all the questions that we have doubts about and we can get an answer from them.
	* Start working on Design as that will help us figure out all the doubts and questions we have.
	* Design is divided into 3 tasks as follows:
		* ER diagram - 2 people who have taken/are taking 304. Assign the 2 people. Vaastav and Stephen
		* UML diagram - 2 people. Assign the 2 people. Maia and Shrey.
		* Storyboarding - Has to be Anushka. Shrey can support.
3. Github contribution
	* Has everyone joined the organization and has access to the repo? - Yes. Anushka needs to see.
	* I made labels and the next milestone. Feel free to add more labels and milestones.
		* Milestones are essentially deliverable due dates. But we can have our own team weekly goals as well.
	* Each task is an issue so that we can better track the tasks.
	* Have folders like docs, design, code.
		* docs has all the technical documents we produce like TOR, Project Plan, Requirements etc.
		* design has our design documents. ER diagram, UML diagram, Storyboard
		* code obviously has all the code.  - src and tst folders?
		* documentation(?).
		* Do we want to include our minutes in the repo? That way everyone including the TAs can see what we talk about?
			* Regardless its a good habit to include meetings anyway.
	* Feature-branch development/. Each branch adds 1 single feature and will only be merged into master once it has been reviewed by all of us. Code Review via GitHub pull request page
	* Travis CI for auto-building and running tests
	* Code Style - JavaDoc type thing (JDoc for JavaScript?), standard front-end and back-end styles maybe a checkstyle program to enforce the styles
