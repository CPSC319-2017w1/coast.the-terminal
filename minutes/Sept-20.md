1. Finalize the tasks and durations for Project Plan gantt chart.
    * Anushka will visualize the gantt chart once these things have been finalized.
    * Something to discuss, how much technical detail should the gantt chart go into.
        * Should we go into detailed tasks or should it be a high level description?
2. Finalize what sections should be in the project plan.
    * Currently we have Overview, Estimated Schedule, Resource Plan, Design Plan, Development Plan and Testing Plan. Is there anything that I am missing that should be in there? Appendices maybe?
    * Once we have the sections finalized we need to figure out what we need to put there.
        * For every section we should go 1 section deeper. Eg: Testing Plan should include Unit Testing, Integration Testing etc
3. Figure out what Agile practices are we undertaking
    * Test Driven Development? Anything else?
4. Finalize responsibilities for the project and who is responsible for each component.
5. Compare and Finalize the ER diagram so that we have the Database Design nailed down.
6. Compare and Finalize the UML diagram
7. Spend rest of time on project plan sections.
