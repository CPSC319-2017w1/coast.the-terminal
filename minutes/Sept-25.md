    * There is a doc on google drive with the sections that need to be in there
    * Any other sections that might need to be there(?)
         * check the slides for requirements; outline for what should be included is written there

* Stephen and I should start working on the database and set our goals for the week.

* Anushka and Shrey should start working on some of the front-end pages and set goals for the week.

* Maia would probably need to work everyone to figure out what front-end functions are required and what back-end functions are required.

* Lets aim to do our respective tasks by next Wednesday.

* Ask TA for feedback on Piazza about previous milestone and ask any follow-up questions that we had thought of for the Coast Capital people.
