  	<td>Feedback for the project plan</td>

      <p>The plan was good overall but the chart was not in depth enough. The chart should have included everything we had described.</p>

  	<td>Plan for the requirements doc</td>

      <ul>
        <li>Will be including the mock up for adding contractors</li>
        <li>Requirements doc should not include the actual mock up, but it’s good if it’s in the appendices</li>
        <li>Are setting up AWS and database (will be more in the design doc rather than requirements)</li>
        <li>A system-flow diagram and a use-case diagram</li>
        <li>The RTM should be in the doc or the appendix, it should not matter</li>
        <li>Compared to the chart in the slides on RTM, ours should be as detailed.</li>
        <li>The most important thing in the doc is functional requirements which should include diagrams and charts. After that non-functional requirements.</li>
        <li>Use cases should be included but not be overly detailed, just cover the things that need to be covered.</li>

  	<td>What type of graphing functionality do we want to show?</td>
    <td>
      <p>Pre-defined graphs vs. making graphs on-the-go:</p>
      <p>It should be good enough to have pre-defined graphs for the users to select</p>

  	<td>Can we have the mock looked at by CC?</td>

      <p>Yes, we can send our mock to them and they should give us feedback.</p>

  	<td>If there’s a major scope creep or a requirement changes, how will we handle it?</td>

      <p>Since we’re starting implementation early we’re worried that we will encounter major requirement changes. We do not have to worry about that.</p>

  	<td>What is the expected capacity? What is the expected frequency of the generated reports?</td>
    <td>
      <p>No data is ever deleted and there is usually around 50 active contractors each month.</p>
      <p>We might be restricted by the API calls we can make. We need to be able to generate the graphs on a daily basis. We also have to make sure we have proper licensing permissions regarding commercial use.</p>
